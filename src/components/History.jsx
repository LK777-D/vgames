      <h2>Video Games History </h2>
      <p>
        Video game history traces a captivating evolution from humble beginnings
        to a global phenomenon. Starting with rudimentary games like Pong in the
        1970s, the industry quickly advanced through console revolutions,
        introducing iconic systems like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo
        Entertainment System. The 1990s marked a turning point with 3D graphics,
        giving rise to immersive titles like Super Mario 64 and Quake. The 21st
        century saw the explosion of online multiplayer gaming, MMORPGs like
        World of Warcraft, and the advent of mobile gaming. Today, video games
        encompass diverse genres, technologies, and platforms, bridging
        entertainment, art, and technology in an ever-expanding narrative.
